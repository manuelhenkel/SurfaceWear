# SurfaceWear
This repository includes data on abrasive, adhesive, and erosive surface wear on Polytetrafluorethylen (PTFE), aluminum and articular cartilage (obtained from pigs' knee joints):
Each data set contains the metrological parameters (defined in DIN EN ISO 25178-2:2012-09) charcterizing the surface.
